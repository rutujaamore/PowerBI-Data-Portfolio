**Power BI Data Analytics Portfolio | Rutuja More**

**Analyst Profile**: My focus is bridging raw data to direct business action. This portfolio demonstrates end-to-end data pipelines: from complex Power Query transformations and robust data modeling to implementing performance-critical DAX and delivering targeted, visualization-based insights.

**Technical Stack**
Data Shaping: Power Query (M Language) for data cleansing, custom columns, and complex table joins/unpivots.
Modeling & Logic: DAX for advanced measures, calculated tables, and establishing a canonical Star Schema.
Databases: SQL for querying and manipulating relational data; experience with relational database concepts.
Visualization: Power BI Desktop, emphasis on clarity, mobile optimization, and user-driven filtering logic.

**Project Index**
Each project folder below contains a detailed README.md (project narrative), high-resolution dashboard screenshots, and the native .pbix file.

All project files (.pbix, screenshots, and a detailed technical narrative) are housed within their respective folders.

I am actively building out Project 02 and 03. For a detailed walk-through of the Power Query steps and the DAX engine in any project, please reach out directly - I am happy to dive deep into the technical execution.
